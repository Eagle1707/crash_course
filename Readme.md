## Pythonic Crash Course

This is a simple presentation cum tutorial. It serves two tasks. Firstly, how I became interested in programming and secondly, it teaches the basics of python programming by doing three separate projects.

The Python Basics notebook is created by the [Waterloo Python User Group](http://watpy.ca/blog/post/learn-code-python-review-feb-2013). The presentation and the projects notebook is created by me.
